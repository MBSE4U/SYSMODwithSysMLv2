# SYSMOD for SysML v2


A SysML v2 library and associated tools for the MBSE methodology SYSMOD are being developed here.

It is currently still a work in progress and has little to no documentation. There is no official release yet.

Any feedback is appreciated: [tim@mbse4u.com ](mailto:tim@mbse4u.com).
